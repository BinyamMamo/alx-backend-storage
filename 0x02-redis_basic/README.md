# 🏗️ 0x02. Redis Basic

## 📝 Project Description

The project serves as a comprehensive guide 📚 to leveraging Redis for basic operations within Python applications 🐍. It offers step-by-step instructions 📝 and tasks to implement various functionalities using Redis as a cache system 💽. From storing and retrieving data 📥📤 to managing lists 📋, this project aims to acquaint users with Redis and its practical applications in Python development 💻.

## 🛠️ Requirements and Dependencies

- Python 3.7 🐍
- Redis 🎈
- `redis` Python library 📚

## 📚 Tasks

### 0. Writing strings to Redis ✍️

**Task Requirements 📜:**
Create a `Cache` class that utilizes Redis for basic operations. Implement a method to store data in Redis using a random key and return the key.

**Files 🗂️:** 
- **[exercise.py](exercise.py)**

**Description 📃:** 
The `Cache` class defines methods to interact with Redis, including storing data with a random key generated by the `store` method.

### 1. Reading from Redis and recovering original type 📖

**Task Requirements 📜:**
Implement a method to retrieve data from Redis and optionally convert it back to the desired format. Also, create methods to automatically convert data to string or integer types.

**Files 🗂️:** 
- **[exercise.py](exercise.py)**

**Description 📃:** 
The `get` method of the `Cache` class retrieves data from Redis and optionally applies a conversion function, while `get_str` and `get_int` methods automatically convert data to string and integer types, respectively.

### 2. Incrementing values 🔢

**Task Requirements 📜:**
Implement a decorator to count method calls and increment values in Redis. Decorate the `store` method of the `Cache` class to count the number of times it's called.

**Files 🗂️:** 
- **[exercise.py](exercise.py)**

**Description 📃:** 
The `count_calls` decorator is used to count the number of times a method is called and increments the count in Redis. The `store` method of the `Cache` class is decorated with `count_calls` to count its calls.

### 3. Storing lists 📦

**Task Requirements 📜:**
Implement a decorator to store the history of inputs and outputs for a particular function in Redis. Decorate the `store` method of the `Cache` class to store input and output history.

**Files 🗂️:** 
- **[exercise.py](exercise.py)**

**Description 📃:** 
The `call_history` decorator stores input and output history of a function in Redis. The `store` method of the `Cache` class is decorated with `call_history` to store its input and output history.

### 4. Retrieving lists 📜

**Task Requirements 📜:**
Implement a function to display the history of calls of a particular function. Use Redis keys generated in previous tasks to generate the output.

**Files 🗂️:** 
- **[exercise.py](exercise.py)**

**Description 📃:** 
The `replay` function retrieves the history of calls of a particular function from Redis and displays it.

## 🌟 Concluding Paragraph

Throughout this project 📚, I implemented various functionalities using Redis as a cache system 💽 in Python 🐍. I learned how to interact with Redis using the `redis` library 📚 and how to implement caching mechanisms ⚙️ for efficient data storage 🗄️ and retrieval 📥.
